Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.
Assume both $$(s_n)$$ and $$(t_n)$$ are sequences of real numbers.

a) The set $$\{\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{R}\}$$ is uncountable.

b) The Well-Ordering Principle says that every set of integers has a minimum element.

c) Any set of real numbers which is bounded above has a maximum

d) The set $$\{(1,2),(2,1),(3,3)\}$$ is a relation from $$\mathbb{Z}$$ to $$\mathbb{R}$$

e) The number $$x = 0.123123123123\dots$$ is rational

## Problem 2

a) Write down the five field axioms, the four order axioms, and the completeness axiom

b) State the definition of a supremum

c) Carefully state the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

## Problem 3

a) Give the definition of an upper bound

b) Is the set

$$\left\lbrace\frac{1}{x^2-3}: x\in\mathbb Q\right\rbrace$$

bounded above?  Carefully justify your answer.

## Problem 4

a) Write the definition of a relation $$\mathcal R$$ from a set $$A$$ to a set $$B$$

b) Write what it means for a relation $$\mathcal R$$ on a set $$A$$ to be reflexive.  What about symmetric?  Transitive?  An equivalence relation?

c) Give an example of a relation which is reflexive, but not symmetric or transitive.

## Problem 5

Consider the relation from $$\mathbb{Z}$$ to $$\mathbb{Z}_+$$ defined by

$$\mathcal R = \{(x+y,xy^2): x\in\mathbb{Z}_+,\ \ y\in\mathbb{Z}\},$$

a) Write what it means for a relation $$\mathcal R$$ from a set $$A$$ to a set $$B$$ to be a function

b) Is $$f(x)$$ a function?  Carefully explain.

## Problem 6

For any subset $$A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$$, define $$-A = \{-x: x\in A\}.$$

a) Suppose that $$A$$ is bounded above.  Define the supremum of $$A$$.

b) Suppose that $$A$$ is bounded both above and below.  Prove that $$\sup(-A) = -\inf(A)$$ and $$\inf(-A)=-\sup(A)$$.

## Problem 7

Consider the set

$$\left\lbrace\frac{2n^2+3}{n^2+2n}: n\in\mathbb{Z}_+\right\rbrace$$

a) Explain why the set has a supremum

b) Find the supremum of the set

c) Carefully prove that the supremum you found is the supremum of the set


## Problem 8

Consider the family of sets $$\{A_i: i\in I\}$$

with index set $$I=\mathbb{Z}_+$$ and with $$A_i = (-1/i,1/i)$$.

* (a) Determine the value of $$\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i$$

* (b) Carefully prove your answer in part (a)

* (c) Determine the value of $$\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i$$

* (d) Carefully prove your answer in part (d)
