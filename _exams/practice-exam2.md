Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.
Assume both $$(s_n)$$ and $$(t_n)$$ are sequences of real numbers.

a) In a metric space $$M$$ with the discrete metric, every subset is both open and closed

b) The union of any family of closed sets is closed

c) Every open subset of $$\mathbb{R}$$ with the Euclidean metric is a countable union of disjoint open intervals

d) A convergent sequence must be bounded

e) Every accumulation point is also an adherent point

## Problem 2

a) Write down the definition of $$\{x_n\}$$ being a Cauchy sequence and the definition of $$\{x_n\}$$ converging to $$L$$.

b) State the definition of an open cover of a set

c) Carefully state the Heine-Borel Theorem and Lindelof's Theorem.

## Problem 3

a) Write down the definition of a metric space.

b) Carefully prove that in a metric space $$(M,d)$$, the open ball 

$$B_M(x,r) = \{y\in M: d(x,y) < r\}$$

is an open set.

## Problem 4

In this problem, let $$M=\mathbb{R}$$ with the Euclidean metric

a) Write down the definition of an adherent point and an accumulation point of a set $$S\subseteq M$$

b) Prove that $$0$$ is an accumulation point of the set

$$S = \{x\in M: 0 < x < 1,\ \ \text{$x$ is irrational}\}.$$

## Problem 5

a) Define the closure $$\overline{S}$$ of a subset $$S$$ of a metric space $$(M,d)$$

b) Prove that $$\overline{S}$$ is closed in $$M$$

## Problem 6

a) Write down the definition of a subset $$S\subseteq M$$ of a metric space $$(M,d)$$ being compact

b) Let $$M=\mathbb{R}$$ with the Euclidean metric.  Prove that the half-open interval $(0,1]$ is not compact directly from the definitions, ie. without using the Heine-Borel Theorem.


## Problem 7

Let $$M=\mathbb{R}$$ with the Euclidean metric and consider the subspace

$$S = \{0\}\cup \{\frac{1}{n}: n\in\mathbb{Z}_+\}.$$

a) Show that if $$x\in S$$ is nonzero, then the singleton set $$\{x\}$$ is open in the subspace $$S$$.

b) Show that the singleton set $$\{0\}$$ is not open in $$S$$

BONUS PRACTICE: is $$S$$ a compact metric space?  Why or why not?

## Problem 8

Suppose that $$\{x_n\}$$ is a monotone decreasing sequence of real numbers which is bounded below.

a) Show that using the Euclidean metric, $$\{x_n\}$$ will converge (without using the Monotone Convergence Theorem!)

b) Give an example showing that under the discrete metric, $$\{x_n\}$$ actually might not converge
