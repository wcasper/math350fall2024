### Directions
Solve the following problems and write up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* written on ancient parchement with a quill and then flown to the instructor via owl post like in Harry Potter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

You will be graded based on *completion* of all of the assigned problems, along with in-depth grading of *select* problems which will not be revealed until after the homework is graded.

**Remember:** Success in any math class is based on *practice*.  The assigned homework problems are the **bare minimum**.  You should strive to do as many problems as possible from the textbook.

### Problems

Note: in Apstol's notation, $$A\sim B$$ means $$\lvert A\rvert = \lvert B\rvert$$.

* 2.2,2.7,2.9,2.11,2.12,2.18

Additional problem: Let $A$ be an infinite set and suppose $q$ is an element that is not in $A$.  Prove that $A$ and $A\cup\{q\}$ have the same cardinality.
