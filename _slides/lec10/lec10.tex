% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\begin{frame}{Adherent and Accumulation Points}
\begin{defn}
A point $\vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is called an \textbf{adherent point} if for all $r > 0$ the ball $B(\vec x; r)$ contains at least one element of $A$.\\
\pause
It is called an \textbf{accumulation point} if for all $r > 0$ the ball $B(\vec x; r)$ contains at least one element of $A$ {\color{red} different from $\vec x$}.
\end{defn}
\pause
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item every point in $A$ is adherent
\pause
\item accumulation points are adherent points
\pause
\item $-1$ is an accumulation point of $(-1,1)$.
\pause
\item suprema and infima are accumulation points!
\pause
\item $0$ is an accumulation point of $\{1/1,1/2,1/3,\dots\}$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Characterizing accumulation points}
\begin{thm}[Apostol Theorem 3.17]
A point $\vec x$ is an accumulation point of $A$ if and only if for all $r > 0$, the ball $B(\vec x; r)$ contains infinitely many points of $A$.
\end{thm}
\pause
\begin{proof}
\pause
Obviously, if for all $r > 0$, the ball $B(\vec x; r)$ contains infinitely many points of $A$, then it contains at least one point of $A$ different from $\vec x$, so it's an accumulation point.\\
\pause
Suppose instead that $\vec x$ is an accumulation point and let $r > 0$.\\
\pause
It suffices to show that the set $C = (B(\vec x; r)\backslash\{\vec x\})\cap A$ is infinite.\\
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Characterizing accumulation points}
\begin{thm}[Apostol Theorem 3.17]
A point $\vec x$ is an accumulation point of $A$ if for all $r > 0$, the ball $B(\vec x; r)$ contains infinitely many points of $A$.
\end{thm}
\pause
\begin{proof}
\pause
Suppose that $C$ is finite.\\
\pause
Then the set $\{|\vec y - \vec x|: \vec y\in C\}$ is also finite.\\
\pause
It is also nonempty and has only positive values.\ \pause This means that it has a minimum value $s > 0$.\\
\pause
Since $\vec x$ is an accumulation point, $B(\vec x; s)\cap A$ has an element $\vec y$ different from $\vec x$.\\
\pause
However, $\vec y\in C$ and $|\vec y - \vec x| < s$, contradicting the minimality of $s$.\\
\pause
We conclude that $C$ is infinite.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Closure of a set}
\begin{defn}
The \textbf{closure} of a set $A$ is the set $\overline{A}$ of all adherent points of $A$
\end{defn}
\pause
\begin{thm}[Apostol Theorem 3.18, 3.20, 3.22]
A set is closed if and only if it contains all of its adherent points (ie. $A= \overline{A}$), or equivalently if and only if $A$ contains all of its accumulation points. 
\end{thm}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Closure of a set}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $A$ is closed.\\
\pause
Then $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash A$ is open.\\
\pause
If $\vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n\backslash A$, then there exist $r > 0$ such that $B(\vec x; r)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\backslash A$.\\
\pause
This means that $B(\vec x; r)\cap A = \varnothing$.\\
\pause
Thus $\vec x$ is not an adherent point of $A$.\\
\pause
Thus every adherent point of $A$ is an element of $A$.\\
\pause
Conversely, suppse that $A$ contains all of its accumulation points.\\
\pause
If $\vec x\in \mathbb R^n\backslash A$, then $\vec x$ is not an accumulation point.\\
\pause
Therefore there exists $r > 0$ with $B(\vec x; r)\cap A = \varnothing$.\\
\pause
This implies that $B(\vec x; r)\subseteq \mathbb R^n\backslash A$.\\
\pause
Thus $\vec x$ is an interior point of $\mathbb R^n\backslash A$.\\
\pause
Since $\vec x$ was an arbitrary element of $\mathbb R^n\backslash A$, this proves $\mathbb R^n\backslash A$ is open.\\
\pause
Therefore $A$ is closed.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Closures are closed}
\begin{thm}
If $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is any set, then $\overline{A}$ is closed.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Exercise!
\end{proof}
\end{frame}
