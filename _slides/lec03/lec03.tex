% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can

% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Real Analysis Lecture 3}

\subsection{Suprema and Infima}
\begin{frame}{Completeness Axiom}
Last time, we finished with the Completeness Axiom:
\pause
\begin{enumerate}[\text{A}1]
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\pause
\item \textbf{completeness axiom}: if $S$ is any subset of real numbers which is bounded above, then it has a supremum $\sup(S)$
\end{enumerate}
\pause
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item $3$ is the supremum of $(0,3)$
\pause
\item $1$ is the supremum of
$$\left\lbrace
\frac{n}{n+1}: n\in\mathbb{Z}_+
\right\rbrace$$
\pause
\item $\pi$ is the supremum of
$$\{3,3.1,3.14,3.141,3.1415,3.14159,3.141592,\dots\}.$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Challenge}
\begin{prob}
Prove that if $A$ is a set of integers that is bounded above, then $A$ has a maximum.
\end{prob}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Challenge}
\begin{soln}
The set $A$ is bounded above, so it has a supremum $b=\sup(A)$. \\
\pause
Since $b-1$ is not an upper bound, so there exists $a\in A$ with $b-1 < a$. \\
\pause
If $a'\in A$, then $a'$ is an integer and therefore $a' = a+k$ for $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. \\
\pause
Since $b$ is an upper bound, $b\geq a+k>b-1+k$, making $0 > k-1$. \\
\pause
Therefore $k\leq 0$ and $a'\leq a$. \\
\pause
It follows that $a$ is an upper bound of $A$, and since $a\in A$ it is a maximum.
\end{soln}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Lower bounds and infima}
A \textbf{lower bound} for a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is a number $b$ such that
$$b \leq x\quad\text{for all}\ x\in S.$$
\pause
In this case, we say $S$ is \textbf{bounded below} by $b$.\\
\pause
If $b\in S$ also, then $b$ is called a \textbf{minimal element} of $S$.
\pause
An \textbf{infimum} of a set $S$ of real numbers is a real number $b\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $b$ is a lower bound of $S$
\item if $b<b'$, then $b'$ is not a lower bound of $S$
\end{itemize}
\pause
In other words
$$\text{an infimum is a \bf{greatest lower bound}}$$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Properties of Suprema}
The first property of suprema is that they must be arbitrarily close to elements of the set.
\begin{thm}[Approximation Property]
Let $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be bounded above, and let $b = \sup(S)$.
Then for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $a\in S$ with
$$b-\epsilon < a \leq b.$$
\end{thm}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Properties of Suprema}
\begin{proof}
Since $b-\epsilon < b$, the definition of a supremum implies $b-\epsilon$ cannot be an upper bound.\\
\pause
Therefore thre must exist $a\in S$ with $a > b-\epsilon$.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Important example: The number $e$}
For each $n$, let $s_n$ denote the sum
$$s_n = 1 + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \dots + \frac{1}{n!}.$$
\pause
Notice that
$$s_1 < s_2 < s_3 < s_4 < \dots$$
\pause
Consider the set
$$S = \{ s_n: n\in\mathbb{Z}_+\}.$$
\pause
For every $n$, 
$$s_n \leq 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n} = 3 - \frac{1}{2^{n}} < 3$$
so $S$ is bounded above by $3$.
\pause
Therefore $S$ has a supremum, $\sup(S)$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Important example: The number $e$}
Even if $\epsilon$ is very small ($\epsilon = 0.000000001)$, $\sup(S)-\epsilon$ is not an upper bound of $S$.\\
\pause
So there exists $N$ with $s_N > \sup(S)-\epsilon$.
\pause
$$s_1 < s_2 < s_3 < s_4 < \dots < \sup(S)-\epsilon < s_N < \dots < \sup(S).$$
\pause
This says $\sup(S)$ is \emph{really} close to $s_N$.
\pause
Taking $\epsilon$ smaller and smaller
\pause
$$\sup(S) = 1 + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!}  + \dots$$
\pause
If we remember Taylor series
\pause
$$e^x = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}  + \dots$$
\pause
We've just shown that $e^1=e$ exists.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Properties of Suprema}
Also, suprema play nicely with addition.
\begin{thm}[Additive Property]
Let $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be bounded above set
$$C = \{x+y: x\in A,\ y\in B\}.$$
Then $C$ is bounded above and
$$\sup(C) = \sup(A) + \sup(B).$$
\end{thm}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Properties of Suprema}
\begin{proof}
Let $a = \sup(A)$, $b = \sup(B)$, and $c=\sup(C)$. \\
\pause
We will prove $c \leq a+b$ and then $a+b\leq c$. \\
\pause
First, note $a$ is an upper bound of $A$, so $x\leq a$ for all $x\in A$. \\
\pause
Also $b$ is an upper bound of $b$, so $y\leq b$ for all $y\in B$. \\
\pause
If $z\in C$, then $z=x+y$ for some $x\in A$ and $y\in B$, and therefore $z = x+y \leq a+b$. \\
\pause
Therefore $a+b$ is an upper bound of $C$. \\
\pause
This means $c\leq a+b$. \\
\pause
Next, note for all $x\in A$ and $y\leq B$ that $x\leq c-y$. \\
\pause
Therefore $c-y$  is an upper bound of $A$ and $a\leq c-y$. \\
\pause
It follows that $y\leq c-a$ for all $y\in B$. \\
\pause
Thus $c-a$ is an upper bound of $B$, and it follows $b\leq c-a$. \\
\pause
Therefore $a+b\leq c$.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Challenge}
\begin{prob}
Use the completeness axiom to prove that the $\mathbb Z_+$ is not bounded above.
(Apostol Theorem 1.17)
\end{prob}
\pause
\textbf{Hint:} assume it is and consider $\sup(\mathbb Z_+)-1$
\pause
\begin{soln}
Assume it is.\\\pause
The completeness axiom implies that $b=\sup(\mathbb Z_+)$ exists\\\pause
The number $b$ is an upper bound and if $b' < b$, then $b'$ is not.\\\pause
Then $b-1 < b$ by Axiom 7, so $b-1$ cannot be an upper bound.\\\pause
This means there exists $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ with $b-1 < n$.\\\pause
It follows from Axiom 7 that $b < n+1$.\\\pause
However, $n+1\in\mathbb{Z}$, so this contradicts $b$ being an upper bound.
\end{soln}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Archimedian property}
\begin{thm}[Apostol Theorem 1.18]
For every $x\in\mathbb{R}$, there exists $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ with $n>x$.
\end{thm}
\pause
\begin{proof}
If not, then $x$ is an upper bound of $\mathbb{Z}_+$.
\end{proof}
\pause
\begin{thm}[Archimedian Property of Reals]
For every $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ with $x>0$, there exists $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ with $y<nx$.
\end{thm}
\pause
\begin{proof}
Replace $x$ with $y/x$ in the previous theorem.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}
